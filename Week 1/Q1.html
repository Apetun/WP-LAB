    <h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
    <p>Whose woods these are I think I <b>know</b>. <br>
       His house is in the village, <b>though</b>; <br>
       He will not see me stopping <b>here</b> <br>
       To watch his woods fill up with <b>snow</b>.</p>

    <p>My little horse must think it <b>queer</b> <br>
       To stop without a farmhouse <b>near</b> <br>
       Between the woods and frozen <b>lake</b> <br>
       The darkest evening of the <b>year</b>.</p>

    <p>He gives his harness bells a <b>shake</b> <br>
       To ask if there is some <b>mistake</b>. <br>
       The only other sound's the sweep <br>
       Of easy wind and downy <b>flake</b>.</p>

    <p>The woods are lovely, dark and <b>deep</b>, <br>
       But I have promises to <b>keep</b>, <br>
       And miles to go before I <b>sleep</b>, <br>
       And miles to go before I <b>sleep</b>.</p>
